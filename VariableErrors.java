 * 
 * Welcome to the VariableErrors Assignment!
 * 
 * Below you will find an existing program that attempts to calculate someone's
 * overall grade based on their individual grades and various category weights.
 *
 * However, the original programmer made many mistakes. Using your knowledge
 * from class, try to fix all the errors, improve the quality of the code, and
 * get a correct output for the overall grade.
 * 
 * The math theory underpinning the below calculations is: "Weighted Averages"
 * While none of the mistakes in the below program are related to the math
 * theory, you may still find that an understanding of weighted averages is
 * useful context to have as you're navigating the code.
